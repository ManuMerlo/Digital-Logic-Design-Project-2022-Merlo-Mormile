* Matteo Mormile

## Project specification
The purpose of the project is to implement a hardware component, described in VHDL.
The objective of themodule is, taken as input a continuous sequence of W words each of 8 bits, to return a sequence of Z=W*2 words by the use of a convolutional code with transmission rate 1/2 ,i.e., a code in which for every input bit two output bits are generated.
